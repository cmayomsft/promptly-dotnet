# promptly-dotnet

## Overview
Promptly is a .NET library for building chat bots using the [Bot Builder SDK V4 .NET](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet). 

Promptly provides an API for developing everything from complex, multi-turn topics of conversation to simple single-turn prompts in a simple and consistent way, so you can focus on your bot's conversational UI/UX (CUI) rather than the underlying details of conversation state and turn management.

## Packages
You can install the [Promptly-Bot package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Promptly-Bot/) on nuget.

## Getting Started
To get started clone/fork this repo, open the [Promptly-DotNet solution](promptly-dotnet.sln), and run/step through the [AlarmBot sample 'MessagesController'](Samples/AlarmBot/Controllers/MessagesController.cs).

A more detailed README is coming soon.
